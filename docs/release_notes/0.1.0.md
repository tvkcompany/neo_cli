The first pre-release of the Neo CLI is here! ðŸŽ‰

This companion tool to the Neo will help you create and manage your Neo applications with ease. As we embark on this journey, we're starting with the essential building blocks that will grow into a powerful development toolkit.

## New ðŸš€

- `create` command to create new Neo applications (this is a dummy command for now)
- `config` command for managing Neo CLI settings
- `--version` flag. Use this by running `neo --version` to check the current version of the Neo CLI
